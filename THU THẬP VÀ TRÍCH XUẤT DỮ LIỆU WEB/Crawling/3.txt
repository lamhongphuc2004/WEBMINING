Please check back as we’ll continue to update what’s below.‘It’s Glowtime,’ or the annual iPhone eventImage Credits:AppleiPhone 16No surprise thatApple’s annual September eventincluded a brand new iPhone. This one,dubbed iPhone 16, was “designed around Apple Intelligence, from the ground up,” CEO Tim Cook said at the time, though news out of the event was that buyers of the new models will have to wait a bit before all of the AI features are available. Still, it’s got other new features.The 48-megapixel camera offers a 2x telephoto lens, includes autofocus, and it can capture up to 2.6x more light for low-light images. It can also shoot in macro, and the new vertical design allows the handset to capture Spatial Photos and Videos that can be viewed on the company’s Vision Pro.Along with the base 16 model, Apple also released theiPhone 16 ProandiPhone 16 Pro Max, both of which feature the new A18 Pro chip. The models come in 6.3- and 6.9-inch displays, include a devoted camera button, as well as additional camera features that offer more control both before and after stills and video are shot.

The screen is “up to 30%” larger, and the body is 10% thinner than the previous model. An updated speaker lets wearers listen to music or podcast episodes from the device; a new charging coil promises to charge it 80% in 30 minutes; and it’ll give you 18 hours of battery on a full charge. But among the biggest changes to the Series 10 are the new sleep apnea detection,which was approved by the FDA, and a depth sensor for use while snorkeling (not scuba diving like with the Ultra) and surfing.AirPods 4AirPods 4 andAirPods 4 with active noise cancellationdebuted at the event, too, with $50 separating the two. Both models feature USB-C charging, while the ANC models bring wireless charging and a built-in speaker for Find My functionality. The new AirPods are powered by the H2 chip, which brings improvements to playback and call sound quality. Charging options increase with AirPods 4 with ANC, as listeners can use a Qi‑certified charger, as well as the typical Apple Watch charger.Image Credits:AppleiOS 18Version 18 of Apple’s mobile operating system launched without its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, which will be available later this year. But what you do get is a slew of other updates to your oft-used apps that should tide you over for a bit.
