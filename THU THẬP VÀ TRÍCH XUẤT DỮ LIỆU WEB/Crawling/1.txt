Apple‚ÄôsiOS 18 update became available to all userson September 16. Ahead of the release of Apple Intelligence, the most important new features have been the ability to customize icons on the Home Screen, swap out app shortcuts on the Lock Screen, the redesigned Control Center, support for RCS, and the new Passwords app.But there are a ton of other small and fun changes that might be useful as well.We put together a list of some of our favorite under-the-radar features that you might have missed.SettingsInstead of listing all apps on the main page of the Settings app, which can lead to a lot of scrolling for those with a lot of apps installed, Apple now hasa separate Apps menudedicated to your apps. This cleans up the busy Settings screen and makes it more obvious where to find controls for individual apps.Image Credits:Screenshot by TechCrunchPhotosThe Photos app now allows you toview your photo library without screenshots.
